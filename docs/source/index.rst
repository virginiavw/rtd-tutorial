Welcome to the Basic Trimmer's
===================================

The **Basic Trimmer** is a tool to aid the use of Simple Behavioral Analysis (SimBA) through data preparation. 

A major technical limitation in the study of complex social behavior of freely moving rodents is the bottleneck caused by manual annotation of behavior. Behavioral annotation can be subjective, extremely time-intensive, and prone to observer drift. 'Simple Behavioral Analysis (SimBA) <`Open Food Facts database <https://world.openfoodfacts.org/>`_, an open-source package, uses machine learning (ML) approaches to automate behavioral predictions through the combination of pose estimation and supervised ML.
